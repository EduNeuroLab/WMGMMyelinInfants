# WMGMMyelinInfants
This code is related to our manuscript titled "Cortical and white matter T1w/T2w development proceed in concert during early infancy". There are four different jupyter notebooks included: The notebook in the "mrtrix_pipeline" directory illustrate how we conducted tractography in the dHCP data using tools provided by MRtrix3. The notebook in the "pyafq_pipeline" shows how we identified 26 white matter bundles in individual infants using pyBabyAFQ software. PyBabyAFQ is made available as a  component of pyAFQ (see https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ). The notebook "EndpointsToCortex" shows the pipeline for defining the endpoints of the identified white matter bundles on cortex. The notebook "CodeForMainFigures" shows how all the main statistical analyses were performed and how the main figures were created.
